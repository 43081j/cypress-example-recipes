# Fixtures

You can load fixture data using [`cy.fixture`](https://on.cypress.io/fixture) command. The tests in [cypress/integration](cypress/integration) folder show how to:

- load a single file in [single-fixture-spec.js](cypress/integration/single-fixture-spec.js)
- load multiple files using closures in [multiple-fixtures-spec.js](cypress/integration/multiple-fixtures-spec.js)
- load multiple files once or before each test in [load-fixtures-spec.js](cypress/integration/load-fixtures-spec.js)

For more examples see the "Fixtures" section in [Cypress Testing Workshop](https://github.com/cypress-io/testing-workshop-cypress)
